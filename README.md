Hey code lovers! ðŸ‘‹

 I'm Tatiana Barros, and my journey in technology has been marked by a genuine passion for tech communities.

Currently, I serve as the Head of Creation and Strategy at an agency group, where I collaborate with major brands like Google, TikTok, Pinterest, and Amazon. 
However, my goal is to return to the DevRel field as an advocate. Recently, I was invited to participate in the Creator Program as an Advocacy MongoDB, which provides an excellent opportunity to hone my skills.

I have a special enthusiasm for Developer Relations, Interaction Design, Tech Writing, and Creative Coding. As a neurodivergent woman (TEA/ADHD), I enjoy sharing my experiences about the challenges of working in IT, particularly overcoming impostor syndrome. Additionally, I create self-study methods and mentor individuals transitioning into the tech industry.

My passion lies in generative AI, and I'm diving deeper into this field. I'm particularly interested in GitHub Copilot and other AI tools for coding. Beyond that, I explore the JavaScript universe, creative coding, Processing, p5.js, and animation libraries in JavaScript.
