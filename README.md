# May The Force of Code Be With You! ⚔️ 🌌

# Tatiana Barros ⭐🔫👸

Like a Jedi exploring the vastness of the Force, I'm a passionate explorer at the intersection of Art, Design, Technology, and Science Fiction ⭐. 
As a Technology Evangelist at ExpressoTS, I work like a Jedi Master, making complex technologies accessible and understandable for diverse audiences, always building bridges between innovation and understanding.

🚀 My journey extends as a PrograMaria Ambassador and Tech Columnist at Mídia Ninja, where I focus on areas that fascinate me like different planets in the galaxy:

- Technology and Innovation 🤖💻

- Design and Creativity 💫❤️

- Community Building 💬🌎🌟

- Technical Documentation 📘🧠

🗣 As a neurodivergent woman (ASD/ADHD) in technology, I transform challenges into opportunities, as the Force flows through all things 💪. 
I share experiences about overcoming obstacles, including impostor syndrome (⚫🤖⚔️ the path to the dark side, that is! 👾⭐🔫👸), and develop self-study methods for people to overcome learning difficulties, believing that each unique mind has its own path to knowledge - just like each Jedi's journey is unique 🤝.

Currently exploring the JavaScript universe with emphasis on creative coding through Processing, p5.js, animation libraries, and Generative AI - my own version of Jedi training! 
🪐 Sometimes I venture into the 🐍Python side of the Force🐍, diving into data and scientific programming. 
Each line of code is an opportunity to create, innovate, and share knowledge in a unique and inclusive way. 

Remember: "Do or do not, there is no try" in coding! 
⭐ ⚔️ 💪 🚀 🎶 🤖 🌌 🪐 👨 👾
